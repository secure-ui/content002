    <p>I told them I would make this happen <br>
        I told them I didn't need a genie, fuck wishing I'ma work <br>
        This ain't no Aladdin <br>
        I told them everything was all imagined <br>
        And that my mind was just a weapon that I metaled in to make magnets <br>
        Told them I would win <br>
        I would never stop <br>
        Told them I would make it <br>
        Told them I would fucking climb up to the top <br>
        How I did it? Climbed mountains, wasn't afraid of the drop </p>
